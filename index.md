This manifesto is a collaborative effort to create open, positive, party neutral, policies for Eastleigh. **Anyone can edit the manifesto!**

If you'd like to help write the manifesto, read the [contributor guide](contributing.html) for more details on how to get started.

**Note:** hopefully everything is now working well enough for early adopters to make a start writing a manifesto, although there are still likely to be some rough edges! If you find any problems, or if things don't make sense, [please open an issue](https://github.com/OpenEastleighPolitics/eastleigh-manifesto/issues/new?labels=bug).

## Transport

### Improve cycling routes and rider safety. Discourage car use.

Improve cycling routes around Eastleigh by improving cycling routes, cannibalising existing road space where necessary. Reducing overall traffic speeds via both changing maximum speeds and traffic management infrastructure. Discourage the use of cars by implementing a highly effective Park and Ride and cutting back on parking, especially free parking.
